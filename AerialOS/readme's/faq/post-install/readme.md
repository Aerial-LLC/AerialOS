*ServiWin.exe* - utility displays the list of installed drivers and services on your system. For some of them, additional useful information is displayed: file description, version, product name, company that created the driver file, and more.
In addition, ServiWin allows you to easily stop, start, restart, pause, and continue service or driver, change the startup type of service or driver (automatic, manual, disabled, boot or system), save the list of services and drivers to file, or view HTML report of installed services/drivers in your default browser.

you can change the resolution but, you can break the functionality of the monitor e.g. hertzec, resolution, etc.

what Idle is - Disabling idle states forces C-State 0, which can be seen in HWiNFO, and is in Microsoft's recommendations for configuring devices for real-time performance (1). Forcing C-State 0 mitigates the undesirable delay to execute new instructions on a CPU that has entered a deeper power-saving state at the expense of higher temperatures and power consumption. Therefore, I would recommend keeping idle states enabled for the majority of readers as other problems can occur due to these side effects (e.g. throttling, power issues).

> XHCI (Intel) **FOR ADVANCED USERS ONLY**
- The modules associated with XHCI and the audio controller generate a significant amount of interrupts when communicating with devices. Isolating these modules on less loaded cores can help reduce interrupts.
